End-to-End Encryption
=====================

.. _module:e2e:

Matrix optionally supports end-to-end encryption, allowing rooms to be created
whose conversation contents is not decryptable or interceptable on any of the
participating homeservers.

.. WARNING::
  End-to-end crypto is still being designed and prototyped. The following is
  subject to change as the design evolves. Parts of the specification are not
  yet implemented by the reference implementations. See
  https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-162 for a summary of the remaining work.

Key Distribution
----------------
Encryption and Authentication in Matrix is based around public-key
cryptography. The Matrix protocol provides a basic mechanism for exchange of
public keys, though an out-of-band channel is required to exchange fingerprints
between users to build a web of trust.

Goals
~~~~~
* No central authority: users should not need to trust a central authority
  when determining the authenticity of keys.

* Easy to add new devices: it should be easy for a user to start using a
  new device.

* Possible to discover MITM: man-in-the-middle attacks should be visible to a
  user.

* Lost devices: it should be possible for a user to recover if they lose all
  their devices.

* No copying keys: private keys should be per device and shouldn't leave the
  device they were created on.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    1) Bob publishes the public keys and supported algorithms for his
       device. This may include long-term identity keys, and/or one-time
       keys.

                                          +----------+  +--------------+
                                          | Bob's HS |  | Bob's Device |
                                          +----------+  +--------------+
                                                |              |
                                                |<=============|
                                                  /keys/upload

    2) Alice requests Bob's public identity keys and supported algorithms.

      +----------------+  +------------+  +----------+
      | Alice's Device |  | Alice's HS |  | Bob's HS |
      +----------------+  +------------+  +----------+
             |                  |               |
             |=================>|==============>|
               /keys/query        <federation>

    3) Alice selects an algorithm and claims any one-time keys needed.

      +----------------+  +------------+  +----------+
      | Alice's Device |  | Alice's HS |  | Bob's HS |
      +----------------+  +------------+  +----------+
             |                  |               |
             |=================>|==============>|
               /keys/claim         <federation>

    4) Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob.

      +----------------+  +------------+  +----------+  +--------------+
      | Alice's Device |  | Alice's HS |  | Bob's HS |  | Bob's Device |
      +----------------+  +------------+  +----------+  +--------------+
             |                  |               |              |
             |----------------->|-------------->|------------->|
               /send/             <federation>     <events>


Algorithms
----------

There are two kinds of algorithms: messaging algorithms and key algorithms.
Messaging algorithms are used to securely send messages between devices.
Key algorithms are used for key agreement and digital signatures.

Messaging Algorithm Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Messaging algorithm names use the extensible naming scheme used throughout this
specification. Algorithm names that start with ``m.`` are reserved for
algorithms defined by this specification. Implementations wanting to experiment
with new algorithms are encouraged to pick algorithm names that start with
their domain to reduce the risk of collisions.

Algorithm names should be short and meaningful, and should list the primitives
used by the algorithm so that it is easier to see if the algorithm is using a
broken primitive.

The name ``m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2`` corresponds to version 1 of the Olm
ratchet, as defined by the `Olm specification`_. This uses:

* Curve25519 for the initial key agreement.
* HKDF-SHA-256 for ratchet key derivation.
* Curve25519 for the DH ratchet.
* HMAC-SHA-256 for the hash ratchet.
* HKDF-SHA-256, AES-256 in CBC mode, and 8 byte truncated HMAC-SHA-256 for authenticated encryption.

.. _`Olm specification`: http://matrix.org/docs/spec/olm.html

A name of ``m.olm.v1`` is too short: it gives no information about the primitives
in use, and is difficult to extend for different primitives. However a name of
``m.olm.v1.ecdh-curve25519-hdkfsha256.hmacsha256.hkdfsha256-aes256-cbc-hmac64sha256``
is too long despite giving a more precise description of the algorithm: it adds
to the data transfer overhead and sacrifices clarity for human readers without
adding any useful extra information.

Key Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name ``ed25519`` corresponds to the Ed25519 signature algorithm. The key is
a Base64-encoded 32-byte Ed25519 public key.

The name ``curve25519`` corresponds to the Curve25519 ECDH algorithm. The key is
a Base64-encoded 32-byte Curve25519 public key.

Device keys
~~~~~~~~~~~
Each device should have one Ed25519 signing key. This key should be generated
on the device from a cryptographically secure source, and the private part of
the key should never be exported from the device. This key is used as the
fingerprint for a device by other clients.

A device will generally need to generate a number of additional keys. Details
of these will vary depending on the messaging algorithm in use.

Algorithms generally require device identity keys as well as signing keys. Some
algorithms also require one-time keys to improve their secrecy and deniability.
These keys are used once during session establishment, and are then thrown
away.

For Olm version 1 (see `Using Olm`_), each device requires a single Curve25519
identity key, and a number of Curve25519 one-time keys.

Uploading Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A device uploads the public parts of identity keys to their homeserver as a
signed JSON object. The JSON object must include the public part of the
device's Ed25519 key, and must be signed by that key.

The JSON object is signed using the process given by `Signing JSON`_.

One-time keys are also uploaded to the homeserver. In order for these keys to
be useful for improving deniability they must *not* be signed using the
device's Ed25519 key.

Devices must store the private part of each key they upload. They can
discard the private part of a one-time key when they receive a message using
that key. However it's possible that a one-time key given out by a homeserver
will never be used, so the device that generates the key will never know that
it can discard the key. Therefore a device could end up trying to store too
many private keys. A device that is trying to store too many private keys may
discard keys starting with the oldest.

    {
      "one_time_key_counts": {
        "<key_algorithm>": 50
      }
    }


Downloading Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keys are downloaded as a collection of signed JSON objects. There
will be one JSON object per device per user. If one of the user's
devices doesn't support end-to-end encryption then their
homeserver must synthesise a JSON object without any device keys
for that device.

The JSON must be signed by both the homeserver of
the user querying the keys and by the homeserver of the device
being queried. This provides an audit trail if either homeserver
lies about the keys a user owns.

.. code:: http

    POST /keys/query HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "device_keys": {
        "<user_id>": ["<device_id>"]
    } }


.. code:: http

    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "device_keys": {
        "<user_id>": {
          "<device_id>": {
            "user_id": "<user_id>",
            "device_id": "<device_id>",
            "valid_after_ts": 1234567890123,
            "valid_until_ts": 2345678901234,
            "algorithms": [
              "<messaging_algorithm>",
            ],
            "keys": {
              "<algorithm>:<device_id>": "<key_base64>",
            },
            "signatures": {
              "<user_id>": {
                "<key_algorithm>:<device_id>": "<signature_base64>"
              },
              "<local_server_name>": {
                "<key_algorithm>:<key_id>": "<signature_base64>"
              },
              "<remote_server_name>": {
                "<key_algorithm>:<key_id>": "<signature_base64>"
    } } } } } }


Clients use ``/_matrix/client/v2_alpha/keys/query`` on their own homeservers to
query keys for any user they wish to contact. Homeservers will respond with the
keys for their local users and forward requests for remote users to
``/_matrix/federation/v1/user/keys/query`` over federation to the remote
server.


Claiming One-Time Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A client wanting to set up a session with another device can claim a one-time
key for that device. This is done by making a request to
``/_matrix/client/v2_alpha/keys/claim`` on their own homeserver.  If necessary,
the homeserver will forward requests for remote users to
``/_matrix/federation/v1/user/keys/claim`` over federation to the remote
server. The homeserver then responds to the client with a one-time key for the
device.

A homeserver should rate-limit the number of one-time keys that a given user or
remote server can claim. A homeserver should discard the public part of a one
time key once it has given that key to another user.

.. code:: http

    POST /keys/claim HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "one_time_keys": {
        "<user_id>": {
          "<device_id>": "<key_algorithm>"
    } } }

.. code:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "one_time_keys": {
        "<user_id>": {
          "<device_id>": {
            "<key_algorithm>:<key_id>": "<key_base64>"
    } } } }


Sending a Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encrypted messages are sent in the form shown below.

.. code:: json

    {
      "type": "m.room.encrypted",
      "content": {
        "algorithm": "<messaging_algorithm>",
        "<algorithm_specific_keys>": "<algorithm_specific_data>"
    } }


Using Olm
+++++++++

Devices that support Olm must include "m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2" in their
list of supported messaging algorithms, must list a Curve25519 device key, and
must publish Curve25519 one-time keys.

.. code:: json

    {
      "type": "m.room.encrypted",
      "content": {
        "algorithm": "m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2",
        "sender_key": "<sender_curve25519_key>",
        "ciphertext": {
          "<device_curve25519_key>": {
            "type": 0,
            "body": "<base_64>"
    } } } }

``ciphertext`` is a mapping from device Curve25519 key to an encrypted payload
for that device. ``body`` is a Base64-encoded message body. ``type`` is an
integer indicating the type of the message body: 0 for the initial pre-key
message, 1 for ordinary messages.

Olm sessions will generate messages with a type of 0 until they receive a
message. Once a session has decrypted a message it will produce messages with
a type of 1.

When a client receives a message with a type of 0 it must first check if it
already has a matching session. If it does then it will use that session to
try to decrypt the message. If there is no existing session then the client
must create a new session and use the new session to decrypt the message. A
client must not persist a session or remove one-time keys used by a session
until it has successfully decrypted a message using that session.

Messages with type 1 can only be decrypted with an existing session. If there
is no matching session, the client should show this as an invalid message.

The plaintext payload is of the form:

.. code:: json

   {
     "type": "<type of the plaintext event>",
     "content": "<content for the plaintext event>",
     "room_id": "<the room_id>",
     "fingerprint": "<sha256 hash of the currently participating keys>"
   }

The type and content of the plaintext message event are given in the payload.
Encrypting state events is not supported.

We include the room ID in the payload, because otherwise the homeserver would
be able to change the room a message was sent in. We include a hash of the
participating keys so that clients can detect if another device is unexpectedly
included in the conversation.

Clients must confirm that the ``sender_key`` belongs to the user that sent the
message.


A Possible Design for Group Chat using Olm
------------------------------------------

``m.room.encrypted`` events as described above do not scale well beyond a proof
of concept. In particular, the sender must send a separate copy of the message
for each device in the room, which does not scale beyond a handful of
devices. There is also no way to access historical messages: once a message has
been decrypted, even the original recipients cannot decrypt it again.

Instead, the intention is to build room-level security on top of the principles
set out above, and use the Olm ratchet to exchange key data between clients.

The following is an outline proposal for how this might work. There remain a
number of unanswered questions. Work on this part of the specification is being
tracked at https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-292.

The algorithm that follows is based on that implemented by Moxie Marlinspike in
TextSecure (see `GroupCipher.java`_ and `SenderChainKey.java`_).  The use of
four separate ratchets :math:`R_{i,0...3}` to reduce the number of hash
calculations which must be performed is an extension designed by the matrix.org
team.

.. _`GroupCipher.java`: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libaxolotl-java/blob/master/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libaxolotl/groups/GroupCipher.java
.. _`SenderChainKey.java`: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libaxolotl-java/blob/master/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libaxolotl/groups/ratchet/SenderChainKey.java

Protecting the secrecy of history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each message sent by a client has a 32-bit counter, :math:`i`. This counter
increments by one for each message sent by the client in a given room.

The counter is used to advance a ratchet, :math:`R_i`. The ratchet consists of
four 256-bit values, :math:`R_{i,j}` for :math:`j \in {0,1,2,3}`. It is
initialised with cryptographically-secure random data, and advanced as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    R_{i,0} &=
      \begin{cases}
        H_0\left(R_{2^24(n-1),0}\right) &\text{if }\exists n | i = 2^24n\\
        R_{i-1,0} &\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}\\
    R_{i,1} &=
      \begin{cases}
        H_1\left(R_{2^24(n-1),0}\right) &\text{if }\exists n | i = 2^24n\\
        H_1\left(R_{2^16(m-1),1}\right) &\text{if }\exists m | i = 2^16m\\
        R_{i-1,1} &\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}\\
    R_{i,2} &=
      \begin{cases}
        H_2\left(R_{2^24(n-1),0}\right) &\text{if }\exists n | i = 2^24n\\
        H_2\left(R_{2^16(m-1),1}\right) &\text{if }\exists m | i = 2^16m\\
        H_2\left(R_{2^8(p-1),2}\right) &\text{if }\exists p | i = 2^8p\\
        R_{i-1,2} &\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}\\
    R_{i,3} &=
      \begin{cases}
        H_3\left(R_{2^24(n-1),0}\right) &\text{if }\exists n | i = 2^24n\\
        H_3\left(R_{2^16(m-1),1}\right) &\text{if }\exists m | i = 2^16m\\
        H_3\left(R_{2^8(p-1)}\right) &\text{if }\exists p | i = 2^8p\\
        H_3\left(R_{i-1,3}\right) &\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \end{align}

where :math:`H_0`, :math:`H_1`, :math:`H_2`, and :math:`H_3` are different hash
functions. For example :math:`H_0\left(X\right)` could be
:math:`HMAC\left(X,\text{"\textbackslash x00"}\right)` and
:math:`H_1\left(X\right)` could be :math:`HMAC\left(X,\text{"\textbackslash
x01"}\right)`. In summary: every :math:`2^8` iterations, :math:`R_{i,3}` is
reseeded from :math:`R_{i,2}`. Every :math:`2^16` iterations, :math:`R_{i,2}`
and :math:`R_{i,3}` are reseeded from :math:`R_{i,1}`. Every :math:`2^24`
iterations, :math:`R_{i,1}`, :math:`R_{i,2}` and :math:`R_{i,3}` are reseeded
from :math:`R_{i,0}`.

The complete ratchet value, :math:`R_{i}`, is hashed to generate the keys used
to encrypt each mesage.  This scheme allows the ratchet to be advanced an
arbitrary amount forwards while needing at most 1023 hash computations.  A
client can decrypt chat history onwards from the earliest value of the ratchet
it is aware of, but cannot decrypt history from before that point without
reversing the hash function.

This allows a client to share its ability to decrypt chat history with another
from a point in the conversation onwards by giving a copy of the ratchet at
that point in the conversation.

Proving and denying the authenticity of history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients sign the messages they send using a Ed25519 key generated per
room. That key, along with the ratchet key, is distributed
to other clients using 1:1 Olm ratchets. Those 1:1 ratchets are started using
Triple Diffie-Hellman which provides authenticity of the messages to the
participants and deniability of the messages to third parties. Therefore
any keys shared over those keys inherit the same levels of deniability and
authenticity.

Protecting the secrecy of future messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A client would need to generate new keys if it wanted to prevent access to
messages beyond a given point in the conversation. Each client in a room would
have to reset the ratchet by generating and distributing a new :math:`R_0`
whenever someone leaves the room. Clients should generate new keys periodically
anyway. A 'generation number' should be used to indicate which series of the
ratchet a message was sent with, so that historical messages can continue to be
decrypted.

The frequency of key generation in a large room may need to be restricted to
keep the frequency of messages broadcast over the individual 1:1 channels
low.

Storing the ratchet in receiving clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general a receiving client would keep two values of the ratchet for each
sending device: 

* the current value, to make decryption of new messages quick.
* the earliest known value of the ratchet, so that it can decrypt any
  historical messages.

In addition, a client would keep a copy of the ratchet for each previous
generation of the ratchet (see `Protecting the secrecy of future messages`_), so
that historical messages sent with earlier generations of the ratchet can still
be decrypted.

A client can discard history by advancing a ratchet to beyond the last message
they want to discard and then forgetting all previous values of the
ratchet.
