Room Tagging
============

.. _module:tagging:

Users can add tags to rooms. Tags are short strings used to label rooms, e.g.
"work", "family". A room may have multiple tags. Tags are only visible to the
user that set them but are shared across all their devices.

Events
------

The tags on a room are received as single ``m.tag`` event in the
``account_data`` section of a room in a v2 /sync.

The ``m.tag`` can also be received in a v1 /events response or in the
``account_data`` section of a room in v1 /initialSync. ``m.tag``
events appearing in v1 /events will have a ``room_id`` with the room
the tags are for.

Each tag has an associated JSON object with information about the tag, e.g how
to order the rooms with a given tag.

Ordering information is given under the ``order`` key as a string. The string
are compared lexicographically by unicode codepoint to determine which should
displayed first. So a room with a tag with an ``order`` key of ``"apples"``
would appear before a room with a tag with an ``order`` key of ``"oranges"``.
If a room has a tag without an ``order`` key then it should appear after the
rooms with that tag that have an ``order`` key.

The name of a tag MUST not exceed 255 bytes.

The name of a tag should be human readable. When displaying tags for a room a
client should display this human readable name. When adding a tag for a room
a client may offer a list to choose from that includes all the tags that the
user has previously set on any of their rooms.

Two special names are listed in the specification:

* ``m.favourite``
* ``m.lowpriority``
