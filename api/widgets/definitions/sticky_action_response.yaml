          True to indicate the client was able to honour the request, false otherwise. The client
          will only be able to honour the request if the widget is requesting to be set back to
          the default behaviour, or if the widget is requesting to be on screen and no other widget
          has done the same already. Permission errors relating to capabilities will result in an
          error response instead of this response.
        example: true
    required: ['success']
