title: CustomWidgetData
description: |-
  Definition for a widget's ``data`` when using a ``type`` of ``m.custom`` or using an
  unknown/unsupported ``type``. Currently no requirements are specified.
properties:
  url:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The URL for the embedded content. Required only if the widget's URL does not match
      the embedded content, before templating ocurrs.

      Clients should note that not all widgets which get interpretted as custom widgets
      will have this property, though all widgets are required to have a higher level ``url``
      which can be used to display them. As such, requirements for this field being present
      SHOULD only be enforced upon widgets with an explicit ``type`` of ``m.custom``.
    example: "https://matrix.org"
