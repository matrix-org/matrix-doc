      description: |-
        This API starts a user participating in a particular room, if that user
        is allowed to participate in that room. After this call, the client is
        allowed to see all current state events in the room, and all subsequent
        events associated with the room until the user leaves the room.

        After a user has joined a room, the room will appear as an entry in the
        response of the |initialSync| API.

            The room has been joined.

            The joined room ID must be returned in the ``room_id`` field.

            You do not have permission to join the room. A meaningful ``errcode`` and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection are:

            - The room is invite-only and the user was not invited.
            - The user has been banned from the room.
          examples:

        .. _invite-by-user-id-endpoint:

        *Note that there are two forms of this API, which are documented separately.
        This version of the API requires that the inviter knows the Matrix
        identifier of the invitee. The other is documented in the*
        `third party invites section`_.

        This API invites a user to participate in a particular room.
        They do not start participating in the room until they actually join the
        room.

        Only users currently in a particular room can invite other users to
        join that room.

        If the user was invited to the room, the home server will append a
        ``m.room.member`` event to the room.

            You do not have permission to invite the user to the room. A meaningful ``errcode`` and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejections are:

            - The invitee has been banned from the room.
            - The invitee is already a member of the room.
            - The inviter is not currently in the room.
            - The inviter's power level is insufficient to invite users to the room.
