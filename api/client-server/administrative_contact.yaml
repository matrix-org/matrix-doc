        This API endpoint uses the User-Interactive Authentication API.
        An access token should be submitted to this endpoint if the client has
        an active session.
        The homeserver may change the flows available depending on whether a
        valid access token is provided.

      description: |-
        Gets a list of the third party identifiers that the homeserver has
        associated with the user's account.

        This is *not* the same as the list of third party identifiers bound to
        the user's Matrix ID in Identity Servers.

        Identifiers in this list may be used by the homeserver as, for example,
        identifiers that it will accept to reset the user's account password.
