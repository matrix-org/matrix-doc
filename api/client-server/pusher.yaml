                  This is a unique identifier for this pusher. The value you
                  should use for this is the routing or destination address
                  information for the notification, for example, the APNS token
                  for APNS or the Registration ID for GCM. If your notification
                  client has no such concept, use any unique identifier.

                type: string

                description: |-
                  The kind of pusher to configure. ``"http"`` makes a pusher that
                  sends HTTP pokes. ``null`` deletes the pusher.
              profile_tag:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  This is a string that determines what set of device rules will
                  be matched when evaluating push rules for this pusher. It is
                  an arbitrary string. Multiple devices may use the same
                  ``profile_tag``. It is advised that when an app's data is
                  copied or restored to a different device, this value remain
                  the same. Client apps should offer ways to change the
                  ``profile_tag``, optionally copying rules from the old
                  profile tag. Max length, 32 bytes.
              app_id:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  This is a reverse-DNS style identifier for the application.
                  It is recommended that this end with the platform, such that
                  different platform versions get different app identifiers.

                  A string that will allow the user to identify what application
                  owns this pusher.
              device_display_name:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  A string that will allow the user to identify what device owns

                  given pushkey and App ID in addition to any others with
                  different user IDs. Otherwise, the Home Server must remove any
                  other pushers with the same App ID and pushkey for different
