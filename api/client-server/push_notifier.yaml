      summary: Notify a push gateway about an event.
      description: |-
        This endpoint is invoked by HTTP pushers to notify a push gateway about
        an event.
        *NB: Notifications are sent to the URL configured when the pusher is
        created. This means that the HTTP path may be different depending on the
        push gateway.*
