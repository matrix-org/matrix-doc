# MSC3050: An API to find out which data the homeserver has about you

By definition, a Matrix server stores the messages sent by its users.

Several countries make it a legal obligation for service providers to let users find out exactly
what data is stored from them. This proposal introduces an API to let users do exactly that. The
intention is to eventually bind the API to a UX that would let users browse and/or export the
list of their own messages (and possibly remove them, although this may require further new APIs
not covered by this MSC).


## Proposal

### Introduction

We live in a time of Big Data. Many users do not trust service providers with that data and that's
a perfectly sane behavior. The only solution to this is to be perfectly transparent, i.e. let users
find out which data is known about them.
