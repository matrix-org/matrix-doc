# MSC3066: Retrieve as Redacted

In some cases, we want to debug our servers or provide data to enforcement agencies with some fields
redacted. This proposal seeks to standardise the API endpoints for serving those redacted events. This
is a different concept from event redaction, which instructs all other participants to delete some
fields of those events.
