It is preferable to use the membership APIs (``/rooms/<room id>/invite`` etc) when performing membership actions rather than adjusting the state directly as there are a restricted set of valid transformations. For example, user A cannot force user B to join a room, and trying to force this state change directly will fail. \n\nThe ``third_party_invite`` property will be set if this invite is an ``invite`` event and is the successor of an ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event, and absent otherwise.\n\nThis event also includes an ``invite_room_state`` key **outside the** ``content`` **key**. This contains an array of ``StrippedState`` Events. These events provide information on a few select state events such as the room name.",
