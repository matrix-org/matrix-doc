It is preferable to use the membership APIs (``/rooms/<room id>/invite`` etc) when performing membership actions rather than adjusting the state directly as there are a restricted set of valid transformations. For example, user A cannot force user B to join a room, and trying to force this state change directly will fail. The ``third_party_invite`` property will be set if the invite was an ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event, and absent if the invite was an ``m.room.member`` event.",
