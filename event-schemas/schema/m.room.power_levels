Otherwise they have the default level ``users_default``. If ``users_default`` is not supplied, it is assumed to be 0.\n\nThe level required to send a certain event is governed by ``events``, ``state_default`` and ``events_default``. If an event type is specified in ``events``, then the user must have at least the level specified in order to send that event. If the event type is not supplied, it defaults to ``events_default`` for Message Events and ``state_default`` for State Events. If there is no ``state_default`` in the ``power_levels`` event, the ``state_default`` is 50. If the room contains no ``power_levels`` event, the ``state_default`` is 0. The ``events_default`` is 0 in either of these cases.",
